 * instance should display the received contents in the same cell address as the original cells.
 * It should be possible to configure the port to be used for network connections. It should be possible to
 * find other instances of Cleansheets available in the local network. These instances should be listed in a new
 * window (sidebar window). The user should be able to select one of the discovered instances to connect
 * to when establishing the connection to send the contents of the range of cells. At the moment it is only
