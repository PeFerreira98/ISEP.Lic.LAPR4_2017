 * <h2>2. Requirement</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Cleansheets should display a small icon in the corner of cells that have
 * associated images.
 * <br>
 * When the mouse is hovering such cells a modeless window (i.e., an overlay
 * window) should appear to display the associated images (this is independent
 * from the sidebar window).
 * <br>
 * The window should always appear next to the cell. This window should have
 * buttons to browse over all the images.
 * <br>
 * When the mouse focus leaves the cell the window should automatically close.
 * <br>
 * The images should also be persisted with (i.e., inside) the workbook.
