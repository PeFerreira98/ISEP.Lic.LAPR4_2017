 * <b>Attention: This feature increment and this documentation are work in progress! </b><p>
 *
 * <b>Requirement</b><p>
 * Add support for temporary variables. 
 * The name of temporary variables must start with the "_" sign. 
 * When a variable is referred in a formula for the first time it is created. 
 * To set the value of a variable it must be used on the left of the assign operator (":="). 
 * Temporary variables are variables that only exist in the context of the execution of a formula. 
 * Therefore, it is possible for several formulas to use temporary variables with the same name and they will be different instances.
