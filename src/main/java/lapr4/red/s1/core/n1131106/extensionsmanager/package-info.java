/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story Core01.1: Enable and Disable Extensions.
 * 
 * <b>Scrum Master: -(yes/no)- no</b>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader: -(yes/no)- no</b>
 * 
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 * 
 * -Notes about the week's work.-
 * <p>
 * -In this section you should register important notes regarding your work during the sprint.
 * For instance, if you spend significant time helping a colleague or if you work in more than a feature.-
 *
 * <h2>2. Requirement</h2>
 * Provide a window to allow enable and disable cleansheets extensions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Case "Enable and Disable Extensions":</b> The user selects the extensions where he/she wants to load. The system load extensions selections.
 * 
 *  
 * <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
 * 
 * Analyze how to associate the extensions to a window, which can be enabled and disabled.
 * How do we enable and disable an extension.
 * This window will also be an extension, it will be a SideBar on the View menu that can be enabled and disabled.
 * This extension will serve as manager of all others.
 * The implementation will pass by creating a subclass of abstract class Extension.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>First "analysis" sequence diagram</h3>
 * The following diagram depicts a proposal for the realization of the previously described use case. We call this diagram an "analysis" use case realization because it functions like a draft that we can do during analysis or early design in order to get a previous approach to the design. For that reason we mark the elements of the diagram with the stereotype "analysis" that states that the element is not a design element and, therefore, does not exists as such in the code of the application (at least at the moment that this diagram was created).

 * <p>
 * From the previous diagram we see that we need to load extensions.
 * 
 * <h3>Analysis of Core Technical Problem</h3>
 * We can see a class diagram of the domain model of the application <a href="../../../../overview-summary.html#modelo_de_dominio">here</a>
 * From the domain model we see that there is a Cell interface. This defines the interface of the cells. We also see that there is a class CellImpl that must implement the Cell interface.
 * If we open the {@link csheets.core.Cell} code we see that the interface is defined as: <code>public interface Cell extends Comparable &lt;Cell&gt;, Extensible&lt;Cell&gt;, Serializable</code>. Because of the <code>Extensible</code> it seams that a cell can be extended.
 * If we further investigate the hierarchy of {@link csheets.core.Cell} we see that it has a subclass {@link csheets.ext.CellExtension} which has a subclass {@link csheets.ext.style.StylableCell}. {@link csheets.ext.style.StylableCell} seems to be an example of how to extend cells.
 * Therefore, we will assume that it is possible to extend cells and start to implement tests for this use case. 
 * <p>
 * The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern">delegation design pattern</a> is used in the cell extension mechanism of cleansheets. The following class diagram depicts the relations between classes in the "Cell" hierarchy.

 * <h2>5. Implementation</h2>
 * 
 * -Reference the code elements that where updated or added-
 * <p>
 * -Also refer all other artifacts that are related to the implementation and where used in this issue. As far as possible you should use links to the commits of your work-
 * 
 * <h2>6. Integration/Demonstration</h2>
 * 
 * -In this section document your contribution and efforts to the integration of your work with the work of the other elements of the team and also your work regarding the demonstration (i.e., tests, updating of scripts, etc.)-
 * 
 * <h2>7. Final Remarks</h2>
 * 
 * -In this section present your views regarding alternatives, extra work and future work on the issue.-
 * <p>
 * As an extra this use case also implements a small cell visual decorator if the cell has a comment. This "feature" is not documented in this page.
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>8. Work Log</h2> 
 * 
 * -Insert here a log of you daily work. This is in essence the log of your daily standup meetings.-

 * <h2>9. Self Assessment</h2> 
 * 
 * -Insert here your self-assessment of the work during this sprint regarding Rubrics R3, R6 and R7.-
 * 
 * <h3>R3. Rubric Requirements Fulfilment: 3</h3>
 * 
 * 3- some defects. The student did fulfil all the requirements and also did justify the eventual options related to the interpretation/analysis of the problem.
 * 
 * <h3>R6. Rubric Requirements Analysis: 4</h3>
 * 
 * 4- correct. There is a robust and very complete analysis of the problem with well chosen technical artifacts (diagrams, grammars, etc.) for its documentation and without errors.
 * 
 * <h3>R7. Rubric Design and Implement: 2</h3>
 * 
 * 2- many defects. The code follows good practices although some design patterns should have been applied. The technical documentation covers the majority of the solution although it may have some errors. However the appropriate type of technical artifacts for documenting design are present and the ideia behind the solution is understandable. Code does not "goes against" the design options of the original code of the project. Unit tests seem to cover a significant amount of functionalities (e.g., more than 50%) but there was not test first approach.
